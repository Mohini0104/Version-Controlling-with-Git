1. git init -> Powers your folder to be managed by git, and initialises a new empty repository. It also creates a .git folder that has all the relevant logic to manage versions of your project.
2. ****Working Area**** -> There can be a bunch of files that are not currently handled by git. It means that changes done or to be done in those files are not managed by git yet. A file which is in working area is considered to be not in the staging area. When we do git status and we see abunch if untracked files then these are actually called to be in the working area.
